"""Statistical summaries for multi-seed evaluation results.

Two distinct kinds of quantity are produced here and must not be confused:

* :class:`DescriptiveMetrics` (``summarize_descriptive_episodes``) pools every
  evaluated episode into a single sample. These are *descriptive* values for
  the episodes that happened to run.
* :class:`MetricStatistics` (``summarize_seed_values``) treats one seed-level
  summary as one independent observation and is the basis for cross-seed
  means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals.

Because the two use different sample units, a pooled mean and the mean of the
per-seed means differ whenever seeds contribute unequal episode counts.
