### The Reinforcement Learning Loop
1. **Drone observes environment**: The drone receives a 29-dimensional continuous state vector containing its normalized coordinates, velocity, relative goal vector, distance ratio, and 16 LiDAR raycast readings.
2. **PPO receives observation**: The observation vector is passed through the actor-critic neural network (`MlpPolicy`).
3. **PPO chooses acceleration action**: The policy network outputs a continuous 3D acceleration vector $(a_x, a_y, a_z) \in [-1.0, 1.0]^3$.
4. **Environment updates drone state**: The kinematic engine updates linear velocity with aerodynamic drag damping and computes the new 3D position over a time step of $\Delta t = 0.1\text{ s}$.
5. **Reward is calculated**: The environment computes step reward based on Euclidean progress toward the target, step duration penalties, and terminal bonuses/penalties (+100 for goal arrival, -100 for collision).
6. **PPO learns from repeated interaction**: The agent stores transitions in a rollout buffer and performs gradient updates using the PPO clipped surrogate objective.

## Linux Support

AdaptiveRL is developed and tested primarily on Linux.

The project uses standard Python packaging and should work on Linux distributions providing Python 3.10+. The commands below use the distribution's package manager only to install Python and virtual-environment support.

Examples of compatible Linux distributions include:
- Ubuntu (20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS)
- Debian (11 Bullseye, 12 Bookworm)
- Linux Mint (20.x, 21.x)
- Fedora (38, 39, 40+)
- Arch Linux / Manjaro
- openSUSE (Leap, Tumbleweed)
- Pop!_OS

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing AdaptiveRL, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Linux (x86_64 or aarch64)
- **Python**: Version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- **Package Manager**: `pip`
- **Version Control**: `git`
- **Virtual Environment**: `python3-venv` (or equivalent package for your distribution)
- **Disk Space**: ~1 GB free space for Python dependencies (PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3, Plotly, Streamlit)
- **Network**: Internet connection for initial dependency installation

Check your current tools in a terminal:
```bash
python3 --version
git --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

---

## Step 1 — Install System Requirements

Use your distribution's package manager to install Python 3, pip, venv, and git.

### Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint / Pop!_OS
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install -y python3 python3-pip git
```

### Arch Linux / Manjaro
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S --needed python python-pip git
```

### openSUSE
```bash
sudo zypper install python3 python3-pip git
```

### Generic Fallback
If Python 3.10+ and Git are already installed on your system, you can skip this step and proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Download ARL

Clone the canonical repository using Git and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StellarResearch/ARL.git
cd ARL
```

Verify that you are in the repository:
```bash
git status
ls
```

You should see files and directories similar to:
```text
app.py  artifacts  configs  CONTRIBUTING.md  docs  LICENSE  Makefile  pyproject.toml  README.md  src  tests
```

---

## Step 3 — Check Python

Verify that your system `python3` meets the minimum version requirement (Python 3.10 or newer):

```bash
python3 --version
```

- If your version is **3.10, 3.11, or 3.12**, you are ready to proceed.
- If your version is lower than 3.10, you will need to install a newer Python version through your distribution's package repositories or using a tool such as `pyenv`.
- Do **not** attempt to overwrite or force-replace your operating system's default Python symlink, as this can break system utilities.

---

## Step 4 — Create a Virtual Environment

Create an isolated Python virtual environment inside the repository directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Verify that the virtual environment is active:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

Seeing `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt confirms that the virtual environment is active.

---

## Step 5 — Upgrade Packaging Tools

Upgrade the core packaging tools (`pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`) inside your virtual environment to ensure trouble-free package resolution:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

---

## Step 6 — Install AdaptiveRL

Install AdaptiveRL in editable mode (`-e`) with all dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

- `-e` installs the repository in editable development mode, allowing local code modifications to take effect immediately without reinstallation.
- `[all]` installs the complete stack: runtime requirements, reinforcement learning libraries (Gymnasium, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3), GUI tools (Streamlit, Plotly), plotting (Matplotlib), and developer utilities (pytest, ruff, mypy).

### Smaller Installation Options

If you only need specific components, smaller dependency sets are available:

- **Core only** (CLI, YAML config parsing, kinematics):
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e .
  ```
- **Reinforcement Learning** (Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, PyTorch):
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e ".[rl]"
  ```
- **Browser GUI** (Streamlit, Plotly):
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
  ```
- **Benchmark Plotting** (Matplotlib, for `adaptive-rl benchmark budgets --plot`):
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e ".[plot]"
  ```
- **Development & Testing** (pytest, ruff, mypy):
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
  ```
- **Full Installation (Recommended)**:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
  ```

---

## Step 7 — Verify Installation

Verify that the CLI entry point and environment definitions are registered properly:

```bash
# 1. Check CLI options
adaptive-rl --help

# 2. Check package version
adaptive-rl version

# 3. Inspect the drone environment specification and observation dimensions
adaptive-rl env inspect drone

# 4. Validate the demonstration configuration YAML
adaptive-rl config validate configs/drone_ppo_demo.yaml
```

If all four commands complete with green status messages, the installation is working correctly.

---

## Step 8 — Run Tests

Run the automated test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

For detailed per-test execution traces:
```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

The repository includes automated unit and integration tests verifying:
- 3D kinematics equations and aerodynamic drag
- 29-dimensional observation space bounds
- Analytical 16-ray LiDAR raycasts and obstacle clearance
- Farama Gymnasium compliance checker
- Deterministic random seeding
- PPO policy training and checkpoint persistence
- Random policy baseline evaluation
- Obstacle-density experiment scaling
- Plotly 3D visualizer and chart generation
- CLI commands and argument parsing

---

## Step 9 — Train the PPO Agent

Training means the reinforcement learning agent interacts with the simulated 3D drone environment, accumulates experiences, and updates its neural network policy using PPO.

### Fast Demonstration Training (Recommended for Evaluation)
```bash
adaptive-rl train --config configs/drone_ppo_demo.yaml
```
- **Budget**: 25,000 timesteps
- **Estimated time**: ~20–35 seconds on a modern x86_64 CPU *(training time depends on your CPU and system configuration)*

### Full Training Run
```bash
adaptive-rl train --config configs/drone_ppo.yaml
```
- **Budget**: 50,000 timesteps
- **Estimated time**: ~40–70 seconds on CPU

---

## Training Output & Artifacts

When a training run completes, artifacts are automatically written to disk:

- **Trained Model Checkpoint**:  
  `artifacts/models/{experiment_name}_final.zip`  
  *(e.g., `artifacts/models/drone_ppo_demo_final.zip`)*
- **Training Metadata & Loss/Reward Log**:  
  `artifacts/metadata/{experiment_name}_training.json`  
  *(contains total timesteps, `training_time_seconds` for PPO optimization only, broader `duration_seconds` through model serialization, mean reward, and per-episode return lists)*
- **Periodic Checkpoints** (if configured):  
  `artifacts/checkpoints/{experiment_name}/`

---

## Step 10 — Evaluate the Trained Agent

Evaluate the saved policy weights across multiple deterministic test episodes:

```bash
adaptive-rl evaluate \
  --config configs/drone_ppo_demo.yaml \
  --model artifacts/models/drone_ppo_demo_final.zip \
  --episodes 20
```

### Compare Against the Random Action Baseline
To scientifically prove that the agent learned purposeful navigation rather than succeeding by random chance, include the `--compare-random` flag:

```bash
adaptive-rl evaluate \
  --config configs/drone_ppo_demo.yaml \
  --model artifacts/models/drone_ppo_demo_final.zip \
  --episodes 20 \
  --compare-random
```

This prints a formatted comparison table displaying:
- **Success Rate (%)**: Percentage of episodes reaching within 1.5m of the target.
- **Collision Rate (%)**: Percentage of episodes colliding with obstacles or arena walls (with separate obstacle and boundary collision breakdown).
- **Mean Reward**: Average cumulative episodic return ($\pm$ standard deviation).
- **Mean Steps**: Average flight duration before termination or truncation.
- **Trajectory Quality**: Path length (m), straight-line distance (m), and path efficiency.
- **Safety & Dynamics**: Minimum obstacle surface clearance (m), maximum velocity (m/s), and maximum acceleration (m/s²).

The evaluation report is saved to `artifacts/evaluation.json` (and optionally to CSV via `--output-csv`).

View all evaluation options:
```bash
adaptive-rl evaluate --help
```

### Run the PPO Learning-Curve Budget Benchmark

Train a fresh PPO model at each timestep budget and evaluate every model under identical evaluation conditions (PPO only):

```bash
adaptive-rl benchmark budgets \
  --config configs/drone_ppo_demo.yaml \
  --budgets 5000,10000,25000 \
  --training-seed 42 \
  --eval-seeds 42,43,44,45,46 \
  --episodes 20 \
  --deterministic
```

Machine-readable results are written to `artifacts/benchmarks/learning_curve_budget.json` and `learning_curve_budget.csv`, with one saved model per budget. The JSON reports `status`, `completed_budgets`, `failed_budget`, and `error`, so a partially completed run is never mistaken for a complete one; the command exits non-zero when a budget fails and keeps the artifacts of every budget that finished.

Add `--plot` to render `learning_curve_budget.png`. Plotting uses the optional Matplotlib extra:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[plot]"
```

`--plot-x-axis trained` (the default) plots against the timesteps PPO actually collected, while `--plot-x-axis requested` plots against the requested budget; the two differ when a budget is not aligned to a rollout boundary (budget `65` trains to `128` with `n_steps: 64`).

Metric semantics and the full JSON/CSV schema are documented in [`docs/EXPERIMENT.md`](docs/EXPERIMENT.md).

---

## Step 11 — Run the Command-Line Drone Demo

Run a single deterministic flight demonstration in the terminal:

```bash
adaptive-rl demo-drone \
  --model artifacts/models/drone_ppo_demo_final.zip \
  --seed 42
```

The terminal outputs real-time step telemetry:
- **Step number**
- **Altitude ($Z$ coordinate in meters)**
- **Ground speed ($\text{m/s}$)**
- **Distance to goal ($\text{m}$)**
- **Proximity to nearest obstacle ($\text{m}$)**
- **Step reward**
- **Final outcome banner (`SUCCESS` or `FAILED / COLLISION`)**

---

## Step 12 — Launch the 3D GUI

Launch the interactive presentation flight deck in your default web browser:

```bash
adaptive-rl gui
```

Alternatively, you can launch Streamlit directly:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- **Local Address**: `http://localhost:8501`
- **To Stop the GUI Server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

If port 8501 is already occupied by another application, pass a custom port:
```bash
adaptive-rl gui --port 8502
```

---

## GUI Walkthrough

The browser GUI is organized into 5 dedicated demonstration panels:

### 1. 🎮 Live 3D Flight Demo
- **3D Flight Arena**: Renders bounding arena wireframes, red obstacle spheres, green diamond target, initial launch position, and continuous 3D flight trajectory.
- **LiDAR Visualization**: Visualizes 16-ray spherical rangefinder beams cast from the drone.
- **Trajectory Playback Scrubber**: Scrub forward and backward in time to inspect obstacle clearances, velocity vectors, and altitude changes step-by-step.
- **Controls**: Choose policy checkpoint, adjust procedural obstacle count (0 to 8), toggle LiDAR beams, and set deterministic seeds.

### 2. 📈 Train PPO
- **Interactive Controls**: Select training budget (5k, 10k, 25k, 50k steps), learning rate, and random seed.
- **CPU Execution**: Executes real Stable-Baselines3 PPO training with live status indicators.
- **Training Curve**: Displays an interactive Plotly chart of raw episode returns and 10-episode moving averages.
- **Safety**: Automatically disables simultaneous training jobs to prevent resource contention.

### 3. 📊 Benchmark Evaluation & Baseline
- **Head-to-Head Comparison**: Evaluates the trained PPO agent against the untrained Random Policy baseline under identical random seeds.
- **Metric Summaries**: Displays Success Rate, Collision Rate, Mean Return, and Episode Length.
- **Visual Comparison**: Interactive grouped bar chart comparing survival and collision rates.
- **Export**: Saves formal benchmark reports to `artifacts/evaluation.json`.

### 4. 🎯 Difficulty Experiment (Obstacle Density)
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Evaluates the policy across **4, 6, and 8 obstacles** under controlled seeds.
- **Empirical Demonstration**: Shows how increasing obstacle density constrains safe flight corridors, leading to higher collision rates.
- **Honest Display**: Displays "Not evaluated" until executed by the user; no placeholder or fake numbers.
- **Export**: Exports results to `artifacts/obstacle_density_experiment.json`.

### 5. 📘 About & Architecture

## Technical Details

### Action Space
```text
Box(-1.0, 1.0, shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
```
The action represents a continuous 3D acceleration command $(u_x, u_y, u_z) \in [-1.0, 1.0]^3$. The environment scales these values to physical commanded acceleration:
$$\mathbf{a}_t = \mathbf{u}_t \cdot a_{\max} \quad (a_{\max} = 4.0\text{ m/s}^2)$$

### Observation Space (29 Dimensions)
```text
Box(-1.0, 1.0, shape=(29,), dtype=float32)
```
The 29-dimensional continuous state vector is structured as follows:

| Index Range | Dimension Count | Description | Normalization |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[0:3]` | 3 | Drone current position $\mathbf{p} = [x, y, z]$ | Divided by arena bounds $[30.0, 30.0, 15.0]$ |
| `[3:6]` | 3 | Drone current velocity $\mathbf{v} = [v_x, v_y, v_z]$ | Divided by max velocity $v_{\max} = 8.0\text{ m/s}$ |
| `[6:9]` | 3 | Target waypoint position $\mathbf{g} = [g_x, g_y, g_z]$ | Divided by arena bounds |
| `[9:12]` | 3 | Relative target vector $\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{p}$ | Divided by arena bounds |
| `[12:13]` | 1 | Euclidean distance to target $\|\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{p}\|$ | Divided by arena diagonal ($\approx 45.0\text{ m}$) |
| `[13:29]` | 16 | 16-ray spherical LiDAR rangefinder readings | Normalized in $[0.0, 1.0]$ ($20.0\text{ m}$ max range) |

**Total dimensions**: $3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 16 = \mathbf{29}$

### Environment Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Flight Arena Bounds | $30.0\text{ m} \times 30.0\text{ m} \times 15.0\text{ m}$ | Bounded rectangular flight volume |
| Simulation Time Step ($\Delta t$) | $0.1\text{ s}$ | Discrete time delta per step |
| Maximum Velocity ($v_{\max}$) | $8.0\text{ m/s}$ | Physical speed cap |
| Maximum Acceleration ($a_{\max}$) | $4.0\text{ m/s}^2$ | Maximum thrust acceleration |
| Aerodynamic Linear Drag ($c_{\text{drag}}$) | $0.05$ | Velocity damping coefficient |
| Maximum Steps per Episode | $200$ steps | Episode truncation limit ($20.0\text{ s}$ of flight) |
| Default Obstacle Count | $4$ spheres | Procedurally generated with start/goal clearance |
| Obstacle Radius | $2.0\text{ m}$ | Radius of procedural spherical obstacles |
| Target Arrival Radius | $1.5\text{ m}$ | Distance threshold for goal success |
| Drone Collision Radius | $0.8\text{ m}$ | Physical drone clearance radius |
| LiDAR Rangefinder | $16$ rays, $20.0\text{ m}$ range | Spherical Fibonacci distribution |

---

## Reward Function

The reward function at step $t$ actively guides the policy toward the goal while penalizing collisions and slow trajectories:

$$R_t = w_{\text{prog}} (d_{t-1} - d_t) + r_{\text{step}} - w_{\text{act}} \|\mathbf{a}_t\|^2 + R_{\text{terminal}}$$

- **Distance Progress ($w_{\text{prog}} = 2.0$)**: Rewards reducing Euclidean distance to the target: $2.0 \times (d_{t-1} - d_t)$.
- **Time Step Penalty ($r_{\text{step}} = -0.05$)**: Small penalty on every step to encourage finding direct, time-efficient paths.
- **Control Regularization ($w_{\text{act}} = 0.01$)**: Penalizes excessive acceleration commands (energy conservation).
- **Goal Reached ($R_{\text{terminal}} = +100.0$)**: Awarded when the drone enters within $1.5\text{ m}$ of the target coordinate.
- **Collision ($R_{\text{terminal}} = -100.0$)**: Incurred when the drone's collision radius strikes an obstacle or arena boundary.

---

## PPO Explanation

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is an on-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm.

Instead of hand-coding navigation heuristics, the agent learns through trial and error:
1. **Observe**: The agent reads the current 29-dimensional sensor vector.
2. **Act**: The policy network outputs a continuous 3D acceleration command.
3. **Receive Reward**: The environment scores the action based on distance progress and obstacle proximity.
4. **Update Policy**: PPO uses a clipped surrogate objective function that prevents destructively large policy updates, ensuring stable and reliable convergence.

## Measured Benchmark Results

> [!NOTE]
> **Previously measured repository benchmark**  
> Results vary depending on your hardware, CPU speed, software library versions, random seeds, and training configuration. The values below were empirically measured on an x86_64 CPU under controlled seeds ($42$).

### 1. PPO vs Untrained Random Action Baseline (20 Test Episodes, Seed 42)

| Policy Evaluated | Success Rate (%) | Collision Rate (%) | Mean Reward | Mean Steps | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Random Policy Baseline** | **0.0%** | **100.0%** | **-101.24** | **71.2** | Collided in 100% of test episodes |
| **Trained PPO Policy (25k steps)** | **5.0%** | **35.0%** | **-3.34** | **141.0** | **65% survival rate**, +97.9 reward delta |

*Finding: An unguided random agent collides 100% of the time within ~71 steps. PPO dramatically reduces collisions to 35% and doubles flight duration, validating goal-directed attraction and obstacle avoidance.*

### 2. Obstacle-Density Scaling (10 Test Episodes per Condition, Seed 42)

| Condition | Obstacle Count | Collision Rate (%) | Mean Return | Mean Flight Steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Low Density** | 4 Obstacles | **20.0%** | **+5.00** | 169.0 steps |
| **Medium Density** | 6 Obstacles | **40.0%** | **-15.20** | 136.2 steps |
| **High Density** | 8 Obstacles | **70.0%** | **-32.43** | 88.2 steps |

*Finding: As obstacle density increases from 4 to 8, the collision rate rises from 20% to 70% and mean return drops, demonstrating how environmental complexity restricts safe flight paths.*

### 3. Unseen-Environment Generalization Benchmark

To verify that the drone policy learns genuine spatial obstacle avoidance rather than memorizing fixed obstacle layouts, AdaptiveRL partitions random seeds into disjoint deterministic intervals:
- **Training split (`train`)**: Seeds $[0, 1000)$ ($0 \le \text{seed} < 1000$, 1000 unique environments).
- **Unseen test split (`test`)**: Seeds $[1000, 1200)$ ($1000 \le \text{seed} < 1200$, 200 unique held-out environments).

#### Running the Benchmark
```bash
# 1. Train with the designated training split
adaptive-rl train --config configs/drone_ppo.yaml --split train

# 2. Evaluate specifically on held-out unseen test environments
adaptive-rl evaluate --config configs/drone_ppo.yaml --model artifacts/models/drone_ppo_final.zip --split test

# 3. Run the complete generalization benchmark (evaluates both splits, computes gaps, exports JSON)
adaptive-rl evaluate-generalization --model artifacts/models/drone_ppo_final.zip
```

#### Generalization Gaps
- **Success Gap**: $\Delta_{\text{success}} = \text{train\_success\_rate} - \text{test\_success\_rate}$
- **Reward Gap**: $\Delta_{\text{reward}} = \text{train\_mean\_reward} - \text{test\_mean\_reward}$

Benchmark results are automatically exported to `artifacts/generalization_benchmark.json`:
```json
{
  "train": {
    "seeds": [0, 1, 2, "..."],
    "success_rate": 0.85,
    "collision_rate": 0.10,
    "mean_reward": 82.50
  },
  "test": {
    "seeds": [1000, 1001, 1002, "..."],
    "success_rate": 0.70,
    "collision_rate": 0.25,
    "mean_reward": 61.20
  },
  "generalization_gap": {
    "success": 0.15,
    "reward": 21.30
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### `python3: command not found`
Python 3 is not installed or not in your system `$PATH`.  
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install python3`  
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3`  
- **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S python`

### `python3 -m venv` fails with an error
Some Debian/Ubuntu systems package `venv` separately. Install the package:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

### `pip` problems or `pip: command not found`
Always run pip as a module under your active Python interpreter:
```bash
python -m pip install <package>
```
instead of invoking the global `pip` binary directly.

### `adaptive-rl: command not found`
This indicates your virtual environment is not currently active, or the package was not installed in editable mode. Run:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### GUI does not launch
Verify that Streamlit is installed in your environment:
```bash
python -m pip show streamlit
```
If missing, reinstall GUI dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[gui]"
```
Then launch:
```bash
adaptive-rl gui
# or
streamlit run app.py
```

### Port 8501 already in use
If another service is using port 8501, specify a different port:
```bash
adaptive-rl gui --port 8502
```
Or with Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

---

## Leaving the Environment

When you are finished working with AdaptiveRL, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

To resume working later, enter the directory and reactivate the environment:
```bash
cd ARL
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Updating an Existing Installation

To pull the latest changes from Git and update dependencies:

```bash
cd ARL
git pull
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

---

## Clean Reinstall

If your virtual environment becomes corrupted or has conflicting packages, you can safely remove and rebuild it:

```bash
cd ARL
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

*(This will not delete your saved models or training logs in `artifacts/`.)*

---

## Limitations

- **Kinematic Point Mass**: The drone is modeled as a 3-DOF translational point-mass with linear aerodynamic drag. It does not model 6-DOF rotational attitude dynamics, motor RPM lag, or gyroscopic effects.
- **Analytical Rangefinder**: LiDAR sensing calculates exact geometric ray-sphere and ray-box intersections without simulated sensor noise, beam divergence, or surface reflection scattering.
- **Simulation Only**: This project is built strictly as an academic educational demonstration and cannot be directly deployed onto real drone flight hardware without a low-level attitude controller.
